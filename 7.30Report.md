Today I started learning about javascript (I will be calling it js below), and I started off with some basics.  
First of all Code of js could be directly stuffed into the `<head>..<\head>` part of the html file or can be written into a single .js file and imported into the head by `<script src=".."><\script>`. Besides from that One .js file could be imported to many HTML files and one HTML file could include many .js files by ``<script>..<\script>``.  
Also, in google chrome, f12 would toggle the developer tools and the console within it could be used to test codes. In the console `console.log(Variable)` could be used to find variables and this would be really useful.  
  
Then, I moved on to the grammar of js.  
As js has a very similar grammar with java, there wasn't too much new for me, but there still are some differences. First of all, Js does not have int or floats, all numbers are of type `Number`, so variables in js are declared by ``var name=value;`` and the name cannot start with a number and can only contain two signs `&` and `_`. Also, something I found very interesting was that js has both ``==`` and ``===`` for equality. ``==`` would change the type of the values if they are different (eg. 1 == '1') and ``===`` would return ``false`` in such case.  
For strings, you can make strings like `'string ${variable} string'` instead of using `+` and this would save time. Also you can use \`.....................` to write a string that has many lines. 
Another thing is that Arrays in js could contain any type and could be created by ``new Array(elements);``, where the elements are divided be `,`.  Arrays have many similar functions with strings:  
  - `slice` as for `substring` of strings (just `slice()` would return a copy of the array)    
  - `push()` to add in elements at the end and `pop()` to remove from the end  
  - `unshift()` to add in elements at the start and `shift()` to remove the first element.  
  - `sort()` to sort the array and `reverse()` to reverse it  
  - `concat()`connect the array with another and return a new array.  
  -  `join()` connect all the elements into a string with the parameter between them.  
  - `splice(where_to_work_with, how_many_to_delete, elements_to_add)` this deletes a certain number of elements after the index and adds elements after the index.  
In js, objects are combinations of key-value pairs called properties, an example of one would be:  
````
var me = {
    name: Yida, 
    LastName: Zhou
};
````  
If the key names are not legal variable names, then they have to be within `'..'` and could only be accessed by `object['key']`.  `delete object['key']` would delete the property. `'key' in object` could see if a property is in the object (this will return a bool), but it will also include the properties from the `object` class. If you just want to see if the property is in this specific object, then you can use `object.hasOwnProperty('key')`.  
Also, we should always write `'use strict';` on the first line of each js script.  
Js also has maps and sets.  
A map is a collection of key-value pairs.  
- To create a map, you can use  `var m = new Map([['a', v], ['b', v], ['c', v]]);`
- `m.get('a')` to get the value of a.  
- `m.set('d', v)` to add the 'd' pair to the map. Adding an existing pair will replace the old one.  
- `m.has('a')` to see if a is in the map.  
- `m.delete('a')` to remove the 'a' pair from the map.  
A set is like a map, but doesn't store any value:  
- `var s = new Set([1,2,3]);` to create a set.  
- `s.add(4)` to add to the set.  
- `s.delete(4)` to delete from the set.  
About loops, it is possible to use the `for(var a in b)` and the `for(var a of b)` loop in js. The for..in loop uses the key (index) of the elements and may use some weird elements of an array, while the for..of loop uses the values and for an array would only return the elements within the array. Another way to loop through is to use the forEach() function of iterable variables, but this would not work for a set and for a Map, it would iterate first through its value then key and then the map itself.  
  
Then I moved on to functions.  
There are two ways to declare a function in js: `var Function = function () {..}` or `function Function() {..}`, these work completely the same but the first one would be also good in name spaces and as methods.  
Interestingly, js is totally fine with having more or less (would use NaN) parameters passed in, so it needs ways to manage the excess parameters. One way is that in a function, `arguments` would become an 'array' of all the parameters (it is not really an array). Also `arguments.length` would return the number of parameters. It is also possible to add a ``...rest`` at the end of the parameters when declaring the function, so that in this function ``rest`` would be the array of parameters that were passed but not stated when declaring.  
The annoying thing about the js functions is that when we declare variables in functions, we should always declare the variables at the top of the function, or else js would do it for us without giving it a value there at the top.  
Functions in js always find from in to out. So if you have a function that contains a variable X, but X is also a global variable, then when you call the function it will use the X within it instead of the global one, or in other words the function first looks indside its own name space. Variables in a function are in the name space of the function. Also, global variables are in the `window` name space. So when using different scripts that have the same global variable (including functions), there could be a conflict. To solve this a name space should be declared by `var name_space = {};` and then when declaring a global variable, `name_space.variable = value;` or `name_space.Function = function () {};` should be used instead to declare them in the name space. Another interesting fact about name spaces is that using `let` instead of `var` could make the variable be in the name space of  one block (eg. one for loop).  
In the newer version of js, it is possible to even assign many variables at the same time by `var [x, y, z] = [a, b, c]`, or `var [ , y, z] = [a, b, c]` to ignore a. It is now even possible to extract from objects, eg. `var {prop1, prop2, prop3='a'} = Object`. If the prop doesn't exist, then it would become undefined, to prevent this you can assign a default like for `prop3`. If the variables have already been declared but need to be assigned, then remember to add the statement in `(..)`.  
If a method is  declared outside of the object, then the `apply()` function of functions can be used to apply it to the object. It can tell which object `this` should point to according to which object it is applied. Do this by `Function.apply(Object, [])` where the array is an array of the parameters of the function. Or the `call()` function can be used instead, which doesn't need to parameters to be called in an array but instead one by one, eg. `Function.call(Object, param1, param2, param3)`  
It is also possible to add special features to a already existing function, here is an example of doing so: 
````
    var count = 0;
    var oldParseInt = parseInt;
    window.parseInt = function () {
        count += 1;
        return oldParseInt.apply(null, arguments);
    };
    ````
